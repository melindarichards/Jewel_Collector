Jewel Collector - a math game for young children

This game displays a large randomly selected number and four jewels, each of which is assigned a smaller random number that is hidden from view.

The player clicks on jewels to add points to his/her score.

The player wins when the score matches the random number, but loses if the score goes above the number.
